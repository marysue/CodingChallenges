NOTE:  I didn't record the first 9 questions.


10.  Which feature emphasized in functional programming languages is beneficial in concurrent computations?
    - transactions
    - immutable data structures
    - dynamic dispatch
    - recursion
    - i don't know

11.  Which algorithm can be used to obtain the elements in a binary search tree in sorted order?
     - All of the above (actually, below)
     - In-order traversal
     - Pre-order traversal
     - Post-order traversal
     - I don't know

12. Which of the following is NOT one of the claimed benefits of a microservice architecture?
    - Improved modularity
    - Lower network latency
    - Continuous delivery or deployment
    - Resiliency against failures

13. Do two system threads in the same process share the same call stack and heap space?
    - they have different call stacks and access different heap spaces
    - they both share a single call stack and access the same heap sapce
    - they share a single call stack, but access different heap spaces
    - they have different call stacks, but access the same heap space

14. What is a sticky session?
    - A sticky session is a load balancing technique where each client is consistently mapped to a specific server.
      This allows the servers to store state locally.
    - A sticky session is a particularly expensive HTTP request. Identifying sticky sessions is key to optimizing
      a web backend.
    - A sticky session is a long running HTTP connection. The client can hold this connection open, and thus reduce
      the time it takes to make a request.
    - A sticky session is a user session where session data is stored directly in a cookie (rather than storing just an ID).
      This allows faster processing on the server side.

15. What does the following code do?
    def _(func, items):
        i = 0
        for item in items:
            if func(item):
                items[i] = item
                i += 1
        del items[i:]

    - Return sorted items
    - Partition the items around a pivot value
    - Filter a sequence in-place for items which satisfy a predicate
    - Remove items which satisfy a predicate

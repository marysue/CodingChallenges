NOTE:  I didn't record the first 9 questions.


10.  Which feature emphasized in functional programming languages is beneficial in concurrent computations?
    - transactions
    - immutable data structures
    - dynamic dispatch
    - recursion
    - i don't know

11.  Which algorithm can be used to obtain the elements in a binary search tree in sorted order?
     - All of the above (actually, below)
     - In-order traversal
     - Pre-order traversal
     - Post-order traversal
     - I don't know

12. Which of the following is NOT one of the claimed benefits of a microservice architecture?
    - Improved modularity
    - Lower network latency
    - Continuous delivery or deployment
    - Resiliency against failures

13. Do two system threads in the same process share the same call stack and heap space?
    - they have different call stacks and access different heap spaces
    - they both share a single call stack and access the same heap sapce
    - they share a single call stack, but access different heap spaces
    - they have different call stacks, but access the same heap space

14. What is a sticky session?
    - A sticky session is a load balancing technique where each client is consistently mapped to a specific server.
      This allows the servers to store state locally.
    - A sticky session is a particularly expensive HTTP request. Identifying sticky sessions is key to optimizing
      a web backend.
    - A sticky session is a long running HTTP connection. The client can hold this connection open, and thus reduce
      the time it takes to make a request.
    - A sticky session is a user session where session data is stored directly in a cookie (rather than storing just an ID).
      This allows faster processing on the server side.

15. What does the following code do?
    def _(func, items):
        i = 0
        for item in items:
            if func(item):
                items[i] = item
                i += 1
        del items[i:]

    - Return sorted items
    - Partition the items around a pivot value
    - Filter a sequence in-place for items which satisfy a predicate
    - Remove items which satisfy a predicate

16.  What's one advantage that a dynamic array has over a linked list?
    - The binary search algorithm can run over a (sorted) array list, but can't run over a linked list.
    - An array list allows fast (constant time) inserts, while a linked list takes linear time.
    - A linked list is actually superior to an array list, but it's harder to implement correctly.
      In most cases, a dynamic array is sufficient.
    - Dynamic arrays work better in concurrent environments. Rather than locking every node, you only needs
      to lock the single list.

17. All of the below programming languages are primarily run on the Java virtual machine, except which one?
    - Clojure
    - Scala
    - Kotlin
    - JavaScript

18. Suppose you have the following code which iterates over a large (2000 by 2000) square 2D
    array and counts the number of non-zero elements in the array.

    You swap the order of two inner loops, so that the x loop is now inside the y loop. This
    drastically improved the performance of your code. Why?

    int total = 0;
    for (int x = 0; x < side_length; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < side_length; y++) {
            if (array[y][x] != 0) {
                total += 1;
            }
        }
    }

    - Ite reduces the cost of each branch misprediction
    - It forces the compiler to use a larger instruction set
    - It reduces the number of cache misses
    - The compiler is less able to optimize that loop

19. Which of the following is a common technique for ranking documents in a search engine, on
    the basis of query term relevance?
    - term frequency * inverse document frequency
    - stop words
    - stemming
    - document frequency

20. Select the line of code that completes the function:
    #function recursively reverses a string
    def recursive_string_reverse(string)
        if string.length <= 1
            return string
        end

        first_char = string[0]
        last_chars = string(1..string.length]
        #MISSING LINE
    end

    - return last_chars + first_char
    - return recursive_string_reverse(last_chars).concat(first_char)
    - return recursive_string_reverse(last_chars)
    - return first_char.concat(recursive_string_reverse(last_chars))

21. Given a set of words, the task is to find anagrams (words with exactly the same letters).
    Which approach would be most efficient?
    - Compare each pair of words as a multiset
    - Use a regular expression to search for each word
    - Use a multimap in which the keys are sorted letters
    - Index the words by each letter

22. All of the following concerns tend to be implemented with global state, because they crosscut
    the business logic of an application, except which one?
    - caching
    - searialization
    - metrics
    - logging

23. What's wrong with this code?
    // allocate and return a 2D array
    // (array of arrays)
    int ** allocate2DArray(int width, int height) {
        int **array = malloc(sizeof(int *) * width);
        array[1] = malloc(sizeof(int) * height);
        return array;
    }

    - The two calls to malloc should be combined. It is redundant
    - The width and height parameters are backwards. Height should come first.
    - This only allocates a single column. All the columns need to be allocated in a loop
    - This looks like the right way to allocate a 2D array in c

24. What technique would dramatically improve the performance of the following function?
    fun fib(n: Long) : Long {
        return if (n < = 1) n else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    }

    - memoization
    - bytecode compilation
    - recursion
    - divide and conquer algorithm

24.  [Yes, another 24 ... must have been a different test?]
    Which of the following is NOT a feature of HTTP/2?
    - compression of headers
    - Server Push
    - multiplexing
    - pipelining

    DEFINITION:  HTTP pipelining is a technique in which multiple HTTP requests are sent on a single TCP (transmission control
    protocol) connection without waiting for the corresponding responses.

    The technique was superseded by multiplexing via HTTP/2, which is supported by most modern browsers.

    As of 2018, HTTP pipelining is not enabled by default in modern browsers, due to several issues including buggy
    proxy servers and HOL blocking.

    
25. All of the following are typical use cases for a heap data structure, except which one?
    - Sorting in-place
    - Implementing a priority queue
    - Implementing a binary search
    - Merging multiple sorted lists into a single sorted list

26. Missed

27.  Consider a git repository with local changes. Which of the following would NOT succeed in
     fetching remote changes to the same files?

    - git checkout -- .; git pull
    - git stash; git pull
    - git commit -a ...; git pull
    - git pull

28.  Which of the ofllowing is NOT a common load balancing strategy?
    - round-robin
    - random choice
    - exponential backoff
    - least connections


29.  In SQL, what distinguishes a HAVING clause from a WHERE clause?
    - HAVING cannot be used to filter rows.
    - HAVING can be used with window functions.
    - HAVING can specify an aggregate value in a GROUP BY query.
    - HAVING can be used in an UPDATE statement

    DEFINITION:  HAVING clause is used to filter the records from the groups based on the
    given condition in the HAVING Clause. Those groups who will satisfy the given condition will
    appear in the final result. HAVING Clause can only be used with the SELECT statement.


31.  The below function selects n-tuples values from a list of values. Which combinatoric operation
    describes what it does:

    func([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) => [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]

    - combinations with repetition
    - permutations with repetition
    - permutations
    - combinations

    Definitions:  Permutations and combinations, the various ways in which objects from a set may be selected,
    generally without replacement, to form subsets ... This selection of subsets is called a permutation when the
    order of selection is a factor, a combination when order is NOT a factor.

32.  Suppose you work for a search engine company, and you would like to figure out the top 50 terms most
     frequently queried yesterday. You have query logs in plain text that are stored on thousands of computers.
     Which of the following approaches sounds most reasonable to do this?
     - Search engines store all the terms user queries in an inverted index. You can directly extract the information
       from the index itself.
    - Relational database is the best choice for finding top N results. You could write a small application to process
      query logs, write the counter of each term into a relational database, and then use a simple SQL query to find the result.
    - Redis is super fast and has build-in support for incrementing counters. You could write a small application to process the query
      logs, increment the counter of each term in a Redis instance, and then use a special Redis command to find the top 50 values.
    - This is a good use case for MapReduce. You could write a mapper to process the logs and a reducer to aggregate the results.

    DEFINITION:  MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets
    with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

    A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name
    into queue, one queue for each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of
    students in eqch queue, yielding name frequencies). The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates
    the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications
    and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.

33.  Why do programs with bad memory leaks often slow down before they crash?
    - The L1 cache runs out of space first, and the CPU has to access main memory more often
    - As the system runs out of memory, swapping increases and swapping is slow
    - As the system runs out of memory, fragmentation increases, and memory access times go up.
    - Memory leaks cause buffer overflows, which reduces memory bandwidth available to the CPU.


34.  Which of the following is not an accurate description of blockchain?
    - Cryptographic hashes are to prevent tampering with the data
    - It is commonly used to implement cryptocurrencies
    - It is an open, distributed ledger
    - New transactions are signed by a trusted third-party

    Blockchain definition:  A system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another
    cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

Worked on this with Enrique and Marissa:

You need to estimate the total sales of vacuum cleaners this year.  How?

1. Estimate US Population?  330M
2. Estimate total households?  330M / 2.5 per house = 132M
3. Estimate total vaccuums per household?  2 per house (includes dust busters) = 164M
4. Estimate life of vacuums:  7 years  164M/7 = 23M per year

Marissa participated the most - called out statistically insignificant < 10%; called out
a few additional things to consider.  Enrique called out one thing to consider (multiple/house)

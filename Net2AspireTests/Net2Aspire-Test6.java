//Is there anything wrong with this code?

int [] merge(int[] a, int[] b) {
    int[] result = new int[a.length + b.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        result[2*i] = a[i];
        result[(2*i) + 1] = b[i];
    }
    return result;
}

// Yes; the code runs, but doesn't merge the two arrays
//--> I chose:  Yes; the code merges the arrays, but only if they're the same length
// Yes; the code doesn't compile
// Yes; the code uses variables to set the size of the array
// No; the code functions as intended

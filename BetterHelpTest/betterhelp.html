BetterHelp Challenge
Step 1: Database
Political season is upon us. For this challenge, pretend that you are working for your candidate of choice, trying to help them determine which voters to spend the most time on fundraising.

Given the tables below, write a SQL query that returns:

Name
Date of most recent donation (if any)
Political Party guess as: R, D, or U, where:
    R = Likely Republican (more republican donations than other donations)
    D = Likely Democrat (more democrat donations than other donations)
    U = Undtermined (no donations on record, or R and D are tied for first place.
Address

Tables:

    People
        ID
        Name
        Address
    Donations
        ID
        People_ID
        Donation_Date
        Party (1 = Republican, -1 = Democrat)


Enter your SQL query below:

Step 2: Javascript
For some reason, this form is submitted via AJAX, but there are a couple of bugs preventing that from working. Use your browser's console to fix it.

=================
Here's my SQL:

CREATE FUNCTION PartyAffiliation(in pid int)
RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
language plpgsql
as
$$
declare
dCount integer;
rCount integer;
party VARCHAR(50);
BEGIN
SELECT count(*) INTO rCount from donations where donations.people_id = pid AND donations.party = 1;
SELECT count(*) INTO dCount from donations where donations.people_id = pid AND donations.party = -1;
if rCount > dCount then
return 'R';
elsif rCount < dCount then
return 'D';
else
return 'U';
end if;

END;
$$

SELECT people.name AS "Name", max(donations.donation_date) AS "Most Recent Donation", PartyAffiliation(people.id) AS "Political Party Guess", people.address AS "Address"
FROM donations
JOIN people
ON people.id = donations.people_id
GROUP BY
people.id, people.name, people.address
ORDER BY
people.id;
And the changes to your html:

1. On button, remove the onclick handler reference.
2. On form, change action="post" to method="post"
3. On the onclick handler, change the jquery JSON.stringify({prop: $('text_area').val() to 'textarea'.
4. For the ajax call:
$.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php',
type: 'POST',
dataType: 'json',
contentType: "application/json;charset=utf-8",
then I added an error function:
error: function(request, error) { alert("Request: " + JSON.stringify(request) } });

However, something in intercepting the onclick method and I don't seem to get beyond the interception.

      =========================SQL DB SETUP FOR ABOVE============================
      1.  Use the "people" database in PostBird - already setup.
      2.  Create two tables:
            CREATE TABLE people(
                people_id GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
                name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                PRIMARY KEY(people_id)
            );
            CREATE TABLE donations(
                donationId GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
                people_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                donation_date DATE NOT NULL,
                party INTEGER NOT NULL,
                PRIMARY KEY(donationId)
                CONSTRAINT fk_people_id
                    FOREIGN KEY(people_id)
                        REFERENCES people(people_id)
            );
            INSERT INTO people(name, address)
            VALUES
            ('Person1', '123 Main St.'),
            ('Person2', '456 Main St.'),
            ('Person3', '789 Main St.'),
            ('Person4', '1011 Main St.'),
            ('Person5', '1213 Main St.'),
            ('Person6', '1415 Main St.');

            INSERT INTO donations(people_id, donation_date,  party)
            VALUES
            (1, '1980-01-01', 1),
            (1, '1979-01-01', -1),
            (2, '1980-01-01', 1),
            (2, '1979-01-01', -1),
            (3, '1980-01-01', 1),
            (4, '1980-01-01', -1),
            (5, '1980-01-01', -1),
            (6, '1980-01-01', -1);
